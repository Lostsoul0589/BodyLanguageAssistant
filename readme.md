## Body Language Assistant

This is an application I developed to help me understand myself and others better. It is used as part of my Intro to Xamarin talk I have given at various user groups.

A more official version is currently in development

If you wish to run this yourself, you MUST add your own API keys and correct endpoint to the AzureKeys.cs class that can be found in the Helpers folder in the shared project.
